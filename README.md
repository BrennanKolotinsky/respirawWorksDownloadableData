# respiraworks-download-data
This repo hosts the code to easily download test data for RespiraWorks - a NFP company providing open source tech.
I'm setting this all up as a side project, to help me learn a little bit more about alternative deployment methods/code strucutures; and to benefit the company!

See the product on Heroku: https://respiraworks-download-data.herokuapp.com/

Following this guide for how deployment was setup: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploy-a-react-node-app-to/

To test locally run ```nodemon start``` in the root of the folder and look at  http://localhost:3000
